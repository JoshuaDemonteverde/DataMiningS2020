#Learning R with online resources**

##1. DataCamp offers free R courses  
##2. Alternative resources 

As an alternative to DataCamp, one can use the free RStudio Primers (https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers), which can be supplemented by the open access book R for Data Science by Grolemund and Wickham (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).  RStudio Primers cover 6 topics: The Basics, Working with Data, Visualize Data, Tidy Your Data, Iterate, Write Functions.  If you already feel comfortable with these topics (either in R or some other language), you can skip it.  But, if you are not totally comfortable with them or would just like some more practice, the Primers is a great place to start. 

If you would like more practice after completing the Primers, some other materials that we can recommend are:
Code Academy, Learn R (online activities with realtime feedback): https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r
Data Carpentry, R for Social Science: https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/
Introduction to R for Social Scientists, University of Washington, Taught by Charles Lanfear https://clanfear.github.io/CSSS508/ (Lectures 1 - 7)

For those of you who already have access to DataCamp, you are free to keep using it if you wish.  That decision is up to you.  Finally, if you would like to share links to any resources that you find to be particularly helpful in learning about R and programming, please post them in the #hunter slack channel.
