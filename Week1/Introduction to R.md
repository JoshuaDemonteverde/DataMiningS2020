# Learning R with online resources

## 1. DataCamp offers free R courses  
## 2. Alternative resources 

As an alternative to DataCamp, one can use the free RStudio Primers (https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers), which can be supplemented by the open access book R for Data Science by Grolemund and Wickham (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).  RStudio Primers cover 6 topics: The Basics, Working with Data, Visualize Data, Tidy Your Data, Iterate, Write Functions.  


If you would like more practice after completing the Primers, some other materials that we can recommend are:
Code Academy, Learn R (online activities with realtime feedback): https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r
Data Carpentry, R for Social Science: https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/
Introduction to R for Social Scientists, University of Washington, Taught by Charles Lanfear https://clanfear.github.io/CSSS508/ (Lectures 1 - 7)


Finally, if you would like to share links to any resources that you find to be particularly helpful in learning about R and programming, please post them in the #DataHunterS2020 Slack channel.
