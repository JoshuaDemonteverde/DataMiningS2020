*Data Mining - Spring 2020*

The class would be structure as follows: 
The class is basically structured as follows: 
 
I. Introduction & Ethical Issues in Data Science 
II. R Programming Language & Machine Learning 101 ( object-oriented language, review regression, support vector machine, principle component analysis, and deep learning)
III. Text Mining (digital trace data, scraping Twitter, forums, using API, topic modeling)
IV. Final Project 
 
The three main books we will use are as follows: 
 
Salganik, M. (2019). Bit by bit: Social research in the digital age. Princeton University Press.
 
Wickham, H., & Grolemund, G. (2016). R for data science: import, tidy, transform, visualize, and model data. " O'Reilly Media, Inc.".
 
Silge, J., & Robinson, D. (2017). Text mining with R: A tidy approach. " O'Reilly Media, Inc.".
 
And of course, there will be a few cases studies that we will be reading in class. 


Additionally,
 
1. One book is optional (Bit by Bit). One book is available online for free (https://www.tidytextmining.com/). You only need a copy of the other one. 
2. Data Camp has free resources for R: https://www.datacamp.com/users/sign_up?redirect=%2Fcourses%2Ffree-introduction-to-r%2Fcontinue
3. I am contacting guest speakers to come in and share with the class their data science journeys.
