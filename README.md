## Data Sources 

1. [NCANDS](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/cb/research-data-technology/reporting-systems/ncands) - The National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) is a voluntary data collection system that gathers information from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico about reports of child abuse and neglect.

2. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) - Kaggle is an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners. It allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

3. [OpenNYC](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). Open Data is free public data published by New York City agencies and other partners. 

4. RedpillWomen Subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/. Ask professor for the dataset.  

5. Podcasting Subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasting/. Ask professor for the dataset.  

6. Gab.com dataset. Ask professor for the Dataset 

7. Twitter hashtags: Scraping Twitter using R packages. This topic will be covered in the Text Mining Part of the class.
